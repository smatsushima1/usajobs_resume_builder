# USAJobs Resume Converter

## 1.0 - OVERVIEW
This allows users to organize their resume in bullet points, then will convert it to a blob of text to be pasted in whatever USAJobs resume is desired. The hiring folks on USAJobs don't allow any types of formatting for the resumes, which levels the playing field but almost to a fault. This obviously makes it a pain to review resumes in one large blob of text since this allows for very little organization of structure. But if that's the way they want it...

This was originally a Python project, but later was converted to just HTML for convenience and ease.
